    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Kazzicom</h3>
    <p>I was the sole designer at Kazzicom, an ERP (enterprise and resource) & IT consultancy, 
        for three years. This meant I had responsibility in owning all design activity at the company.</p>
    <p>My work mostly featured in the IT side of the business where I was responsible for the experiences 
        of multiple websites and mobile applications. Within these digital- led initiatives, I used Adobe XD 
        predominantly to craft lo and hi fidelity wireframes. With a lot of the websites, I was able to convert 
        these designs to Wordpress websites using the Elementor website builder. Additionally, I designed a 
        variety of promotional materials for Kazzicom and their clients such as flyers, posters, business cards and logos.</p>
    <p>For each design project, I conversed continually with clients to make sure I was capturing their aspirations and more. 
        Capturing feedback was also something I did regularly to help me in my development as well as to build relationships 
        with our customers.</p>
